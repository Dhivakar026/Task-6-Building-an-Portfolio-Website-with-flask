<h2>This is the About Page</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Dhivakar M, a passionate Java and Front-End Developer with expertise in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I am currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering, with the goal of securing a placement in a leading IT company and building a career as a Full-Stack Developer.</p>

<p>I have completed internships at Iyarkai Tech Lab Pvt. Ltd. and Yectra Technologies, where I gained hands-on experience in web design, front-end development, and building responsive, user-friendly websites. During these experiences, I worked on designing, wireframing, and prototyping projects, as well as developing functional interfaces integrated with backend services.</p>

<h3>Projects I’ve Worked On</h3>
<p><strong>Green Commune Farm Stay Website</strong> – Designed and developed a farm stay website focusing on ecological farming, fresh products, and a seamless booking experience, with an emphasis on clean UI and accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Food Delivery Website</strong> – Created a responsive online food ordering platform with user-friendly navigation, optimized layouts, and interactive menus to enhance customer experience.</p>

<p><strong>Slides and Ladders with Gifts (Java Game)</strong> – Built a Java-based game with custom logic and precise output formatting, improving problem-solving and coding efficiency.</p>

<p>My technical toolkit includes Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (basics), and Figma, along with experience in UI/UX design, usability testing, and software project deployment. I’m detail-oriented, adaptable, and dedicated to delivering efficient, high-quality solutions.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I explore new design tools, learn advanced Java frameworks like Spring Boot, and work on personal projects to sharpen my development skills. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that combine technical excellence with user satisfaction.</p>

<p>Let’s connect and create something impactful together!</p>
